LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
**AwesomeAiogram** is a framework for quickly creating and maintaining projects based on the Aiogram library.

Inspired by Django, we aimed to simplify common boilerplate code with automatic generation triggered by a single or
multiple commands. We focused on making it universal and scalable, like a modular builder where you use ready-made
building blocks to construct your projectâ€”while keeping it independent from requiring all blocks to function.
